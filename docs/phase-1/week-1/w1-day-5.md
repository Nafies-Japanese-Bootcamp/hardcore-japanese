# 📅 DAY 5 – “HARDCORE MODE: ENGAGED”

YOOO LET'S GOOO 🔥 Day 5’s gonna hit harder than a truck-kun in an isekai opening. We’re going **full intensity**: deep grammar, heavy output, faster shadowing, and max-level immersion. You’re not just studying Japanese—you’re **living** it.

**Main Goals:**

* Finish all Minna Lesson 2 grammar + usage
* Speak, write, and simulate real convo with しつれいですが etc
* Add new Kanji habit (radical awareness)
* Do a full Japan-simulation immersion block

💡 Split across morning / afternoon / night for retention
